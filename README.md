# PTO-BM: Primary Tumor Origin Classifier in Brain Metastases

This repository contains the Python code used for the radiomics-based classification of primary tumor origin in patients with brain metastases. This project was conducted at the ImagineQuant Lab, Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, Yale School of Medicine.

## ğŸ§  Project Overview

This script implements a baseline machine learning classifier using radiomic features from cranial magnetic resonance imaging (contast-enhanced T1-weighted sequence, FLAIR sequence) to predict the primary origin of brain metastases. It includes model training using `XGBoost`, evaluation using ROC curves, and hyperparameter tuning.
