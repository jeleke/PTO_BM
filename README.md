# PTO-BM: Primary Tumor Origin Classifier in Brain Metastases

This repository contains the Python code used for the radiomics-based classification of primary tumor origin in patients with brain metastases. This project was conducted at the ImagineQuant Lab, Department of Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, Yale School of Medicine.

## ğŸ§  Project Overview

This script implements a baseline machine learning classifier using radiomic features from cranial magnetic resonance imaging (contast-enhanced T1-weighted sequence, FLAIR sequence) to predict the primary origin of brain metastases. It includes model training using `XGBoost` with nested cross-validation, feature selection and model evaluation using ROC curves. It also includes radiomic feature aggregation and model training with additional clinical information and qualitative information derived from imaging.

## ğŸš€ Getting Started


1. Create environment and install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Extract the radiomics from your preprocessed segmentation masks using PyRadiomics with the params.yaml file

3. Perform radiomic feature aggregation according to the comnputations described in Chang et al. (https://github.com/Aneja-Lab-Yale/Aneja-Lab-Public-BrainMetsRadiomics)

4. Link clinical features and the semantic, qualitative imaging features to the radiomics frame wiht link_features.py

5. Run the classifier using classification.py

> ğŸ“Œ Note: Input data paths need to be configured inside the script.

## ğŸ“¦ Dependencies

See `requirements.txt` for the full list.
